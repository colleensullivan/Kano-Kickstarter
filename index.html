        <h2>Awesome for kids with special abilities like dyslexia.</h2>
        <p>Even if reading is challenging for you, you can build the Kano computer and code!  Kano  introduces kids to some Python basics, and to visual development environments by use of  Kano Blocks, which allow kids to drag and drop pieces of code and invent their own version of Pong, or make some Minecraft creations. With Kano Blocks, kids can learn about programming basics, and even make their own first programs. </p>
